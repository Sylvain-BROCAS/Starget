## Starget project

I want to make a small fork mount for DSLR that could be fully controled by NINA astrophotography software.
The first step is to write the software to control my actuators and to communicate between my Âµcontroler and NINA.

This project uses an ESP32 runing with micropoython 1.20. I use Alpaca ASCOM standard to communicate between the ESP32 and NINA.

This project is hugely based on @RunTJoe's one on raspberry pico : https://github.com/RunTJoe/MiPyAlpaca
I'm thanksfull to him for his help and advises.

A big notebook with all my notes, errors/solutions etc is coming soon to share all the details about this project so anybody could make it by its own.
