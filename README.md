# Starget project
## What is Starget ?
Starget is an ultralight astronomical mount project. I want to develop an equatorial GOTO mount for DSLR astrophotography with ASCOM Alpaca support and I want to build a custom app in the future to get rid of a PC to control the mount.


## Current state of the project
- Alpaca driver : Almost ready. I just need to fix a few issues and add low level hardware command.
- Electronic : Components are almost all selected. I need to design the power supply and to link all of them together.
- Mechannic : The reductor design and mount architecture are choosen. I need then to build a functionnal product.
 
## More information about the project
I wrote an Instructable about the exploratory phase of the project (Some things has changed since, it was only exploration) : [https://www.instructables.com/Goto-DSLR-Astrophotography-Mount/](https://www.instructables.com/Goto-DSLR-Astrophotography-Mount/)
I recently wrote another article to present my project (It's written in french) : [ https://www.eos-projets.fr/projects/starget-presentation](https://www.eos-projets.fr/projects/starget-presentation)


## Acknowledgments
Huge thanks to @RunTJoe that made another Alpaca project that helped me a lot understand how to build mine. Link to his Alpaca NINA compatible switches : https://github.com/RunTJoe/MiPyAlpaca
@dhartkop has made a great work with his video about the reductor design i want to use with his [video]([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwy2hl33Er2lLLREiwp_ang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VtbSvVxaFA)) and repository on the subject :
